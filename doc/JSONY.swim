JSONY
=====

Relaxed JSON with a little bit of YAML

<badge travis coveralls ingydotnet/jsony-pm>

= Synopsis

  use JSONY;

  my $data = JSONY->new->load($jsony_string);

= Description

JSONY is a data language that is simlar to JSON, just more chill. All valid
JSON is also valid JSONY (and represents the same thing when loaded), but
JSONY lets you omit a lot of the syntax that makes JSON a pain to write.

= API

JSONY has one instance method: `load`. You pass it a JSONY string and it
returns the loaded Perl data object.

= JSONY Syntax

Here is some examples of JSONY followed by equivalent JSON:

Words don't need quotes. A list of things is an array:

  foo bar baz

  [ "foo", "bar", "baz" ]

Strings with spaces can use single or double quotes:

  'foo bar'      # <= This is (a comment indicating) a string
  # More commenting
  "baz  boom "

  [ "foo bar ", "baz  boom " ]

Top level hashes can be ':' separated pairs or use curlies. Sub hashes require
curlies.

  foo: { bar baz }
  num: -1.2e3

  { "foo": { "bar": "baz" }, "num": -1.2e3 }

Top level arrays can use `'- '` at the start of lines. Those arrays go the end
of line. Lines can be continued using a trailing comma. Sub arrays require
square brackets.

  - array of 4 scalars
  - array with [ sub
    array { of
    things }]
  - array of 7 things on,
    two lines

  [
    [ "array", "of", 4, "scalars" ],
    [ "array", "with", [ "sub", "array" { "of": "things" } ] ],
    [ "array", "of", 7, "things", "on", "two", "lines" ]
  ]

NOTE: You may want to look at the tests (especially `t/load.t`) to see the full
abilities of JSONY.

= Status

JSONY has been in use for well over a year. It seems to working well.

Development people are working on this in `#jsony` and `#pegex` in
irc.freenode.net. Please drop by.

JSONY.pm is a very simple Pegex-based parser. You can see the quite tiny JSONY
grammar here: http://github.com/ingydotnet/jsony-pgx/blob/master/jsony.pgx

http://jsony.org coming soon.
